# Alias-free-Arrays
Nonuniform array geometries provide freedom for increased aperture and reduced mutual coupling. A necessary and sufficient condition is given for an array of isotropic sensor elements to be unambiguous for any specified set of directions of arrival. The result holds for linear, planar and volume arrays, is easily computed, and admits simple geometrical interpretation.
